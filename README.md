KneonBuilderExample
===================

Kneon is a company that supplies detailed information about your companies products and supplies it to digital writers.  This allows them to get up to dat information about any product they review or right about as well as product images.


My client wanted to use this service, but did not have server side access to the their web CMS or DB.  In order to get around this, I wrote this script to get the data from their public web services and then write out the needed CVS.  The script was set on a Cron Job to update Kneon every evening.

Normally this script would be very simple and just query a DB for active products, but without that level of access, this script was needed.

Client information was removed from this sample.  This is sinmply just an example of code to follow.
